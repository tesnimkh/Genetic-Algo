Knapsack Problem Genetic Algorithm

This project implements a genetic algorithm to solve the Knapsack Problem. The Knapsack Problem is a classic optimization problem where you have a set of items, each with a value and a weight, and you want to select a subset of items to maximize the total value while keeping the total weight below a certain limit.
Getting Started
Prerequisites

To run this code, you need to have the following prerequisites installed:

    Python 3.x
    matplotlib library (can be installed via pip)

Usage

    Clone this repository or download the source code.

    Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

    Run the following command to execute the code:

    bash

    python knapsack_genetic_algorithm.py

    The program will output the best solution and fitness at the end, as well as display a plot showing the progress of the best fitness over generations.

Code Explanation

The knapsack_genetic_algorithm.py file contains the implementation of the genetic algorithm for the Knapsack Problem. Here's a breakdown of the code:

    Problem inputs:
        Modify the values and weights lists to define the values and weights of the items in the problem.
        Set the max_weight variable to define the maximum weight allowed in the knapsack.

    Genetic algorithm parameters:
        Adjust the population_size, num_generations, and mutation_rate variables to configure the genetic algorithm.

    Fitness function:
        Modify the fitness_function function to customize the fitness calculation based on your problem requirements.

    Utility functions:
        The generate_individual(), generate_population(population_size), mutate_individual(individual), select_parent(population), and crossover(parent1, parent2) functions are utility functions that can be modified as needed.

    Running the algorithm:
        The code initializes a plot to visualize the progress.
        The initial population is generated.
        The genetic algorithm is executed over the specified number of generations, selecting parents, performing crossover, and mutating individuals.
        The best fitness of each generation is stored and plotted.
        Finally, the best solution and fitness are printed.
